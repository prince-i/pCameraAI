pCameraAI is a simple android project that allows the user to take a picture and the app tells what is being captured in the image.
I use Cordova Platform to build android application out of web-based codes.
I also use the TensorFlow, the machine learning JavaScript library for web, and connect it to mobile net pre-trained model.

Installation:
1. Must have Cordova, JDK 8 kit, Android Studio and Gradle installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Inside the repo, run cmd and type "npm install", wait until finish.
4. Type command "Cordova build android" and go to path of the APK file.
5. Install and enjoy.
